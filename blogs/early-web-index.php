  <h1>Index of Web 1.0 Aesthetics</h1>
  <p>Technology progressed beyond basic html and css at the turn of the century. No doubt, some of the old static websites were ugly (as programmers aren’t known for their aesthetics), but there is something cool - hipster maybe - about old web design. They’re like record players or 8bit video games. I compiled a list of websites like this. Some clearly have much more sophisticated technology working than just static html, but they still retain the retro aesthetic. All of them have been extremely insightful/entertaining over the years.</p>
